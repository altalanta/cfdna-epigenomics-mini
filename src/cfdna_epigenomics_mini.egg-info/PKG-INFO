# cfDNA Epigenomics Mini

A production-quality demonstration of early cancer detection from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) epigenomic signals, combining methylation patterns and fragmentomics features. This repository implements end-to-end machine learning pipelines with synthetic data for privacy and reproducibility.

## Quickstart

```bash
make setup && make simulate && make train && make eval
```

## JD Requirements Mapping

- **Methylation Analysis**: `src/cfdna/simulate.py` generates DMR-based synthetic methylation data; `src/cfdna/features.py` aggregates CpGs into differential methylation regions
- **Fragmentomics**: Size-bin frequency features and TSS enrichment proxies in simulation and feature modules  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn baselines and PyTorch MLP in `src/cfdna/models.py` with proper train/val/test splits
- **Statistical Validation**: DeLong ROC comparison, calibration analysis, decision curves in `src/cfdna/metrics.py`
- **Production Readiness**: Type hints, comprehensive tests, CI/CD, SQL schema, AWS deployment stubs
- **Notebooks**: Complete analysis workflow from experimental design to model interpretation

## Synthetic Data & Limitations

The default synthetic dataset (n=600, 3 batches, mild class imbalance) is designed for rapid prototyping and CI/CD. Real cfDNA data would require:
- Larger sample sizes for adequate statistical power
- More sophisticated batch correction methods
- Integration with clinical covariates and survival outcomes
- Regulatory compliance for clinical deployment

## AWS Deployment

Run `python src/cfdna/aws/submit_batch_job.py` locally (no credentials required) to see the exact AWS Batch CLI command that would be executed in production.
